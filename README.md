Code for modeling seismic deformation and coupling to tsunami propagation

## Dependencies

This code requires installation of the Clawpack software ([www.clawpack.org](https://www.clawpack.org)).  It was last tested with v5.4.0.

## Examples

Examples are available to introduce users to the code base:

* 2d/sloping_fault: code for simulating the ocean floor deformation
* 2d/sloping_fault_water: code for simulating both ocean floor and ocean surface deformation (neglecting gravity)

## Branches

Two main branches are used:

-master: tested "release" code
-dev: development code (use at your own risk)
